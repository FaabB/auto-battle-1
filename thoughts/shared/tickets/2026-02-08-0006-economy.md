# Ticket 6: Economy

**Delivers:** Gold resource, building costs, passive Farm income, gold from kills, gold HUD

**Depends on:** 2

## What to Implement

| What to implement | How to test |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Gold resource (starts at 200) | Gold value tracked in a Bevy Resource |
| Gold HUD display | "Gold: 200" visible on screen (top corner) |
| Building costs (Barracks: 100, Farm: 50) | Cost deducted on placement |
| Placement blocked when insufficient gold | Clicking with not enough gold shows visible rejection (e.g., gold text flashes red or brief "Not enough gold!" text) |
| Farm passive income (3 gold/sec per Farm) | Place Farm → watch gold tick up by 3/sec |
| Gold from killing enemies (5 gold per kill) | Kill enemy → gold increases by 5 |
| Building type selector UI | Player can choose between Barracks and Farm before placing |
| Cost display on building selector | Each building shows its gold cost |

## Context

This ticket makes the game strategic — you can't just spam buildings. The economy creates the core tension: spend gold on Farms (long-term income) vs Barracks (immediate military).

**Key economic balance (from research):**
- Starting gold: 200 (allows Barracks + Farm, or 2 Barracks, or 4 Farms)
- Barracks cost: 100 gold
- Farm cost: 50 gold
- Farm income: 3 gold/sec (~17 second payoff)
- Kill reward: 5 gold per enemy (low — economy buildings dominate income)

**Building selector:** A simple UI element (e.g., number keys 1/2 or clickable buttons) to choose which building type to place. The current building selection should be clearly indicated.

**Note:** This ticket can be worked in parallel with Tickets 3-5 since it primarily depends on Ticket 2 (grid/placement). The kill reward part requires combat (Ticket 5) to function, so that specific feature should be wired up when combat exists.

Relevant files:
- New domain module `src/gameplay/economy/mod.rs` — Gold resource, GoldReward component (co-located)
- New systems in `src/gameplay/economy/`: `passive_gold_generation`, `gold_on_kill`
- Economy systems use `.in_set(GameSet::Production)` (income) and `.in_set(GameSet::Death)` (kill rewards)
- Gold HUD rendering uses `.in_set(GameSet::Ui)`
- Building selector UI may live in `src/gameplay/building/` (placement-related) or `src/screens/in_game.rs` (screen UI)
- `src/gameplay/building/placement.rs` — add cost checks to existing placement system

## Done When

- Game starts with 200 gold displayed on screen
- Barracks costs 100 gold, Farm costs 50 gold
- Gold is deducted when placing a building
- Can't place a building when gold is insufficient (clear feedback)
- Farms generate 3 gold/sec (visible in HUD)
- Killing enemies awards 5 gold each (when combat exists)
- Player can switch between Barracks and Farm before placing
- Building type and cost clearly shown in UI
